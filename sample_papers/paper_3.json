Expansion of Bitcoin, as well as other digital currencies, has been [PAGE 1] due to lower transaction costs, high security protocols and lack of inflation with respect to [PAGE 1] fiat money and no need of a clearing entity or a central bank. Although, environmental [PAGE 1] issues related to the use of this currency and, in particular, in the energy consumes, have [PAGE 1] been raised by the scientific community, but no signals of limiting factors have been [PAGE 1] detected until now."

The [PAGE 2] innovation introduced by Nakamoto (but it seems there should be a group hided under this [PAGE 2] pseudonym) represents a currency that bypasses the official way to produce and exchange [PAGE 2] money, based on a central bank or a clearing authority, and uses a peer-to-peer payment [PAGE 2] system realised as an open source software. This virtual money run thanks to the [PAGE 2] blockchain technology that create a distributed public register containing all Bitcoin [PAGE 2] transactions."

Results and discussions [PAGE 6] The bitcoin system was born after the global financial crisis with massive interventions by [PAGE 6] financial and non-financial institutions, in order to remove the risk of default of the entire [PAGE 6] global banking system. In this context, bitcoin appears as an innovative tool to eliminate the [PAGE 6] intermediation of banks and financial institutions and create a decentralized system. About [PAGE 6] its innovativeness many believe that it is limited and that the benefits are rather limited [PAGE 6] compared to the present electronic currencies. Indeed, bitcoin makes it possible to add up [PAGE 6] the advantages of cash and electronic payment systems (Alshamsi and Andras, 2019)."

To sustain the network a mining- [PAGE 8] with-rewarding system, ensured transferring of this virtual money by cryptographic [PAGE 8] connections among virtual wallets, for this reason the Bitcoin was also called [PAGE 8] attention among the scientific community, and later by industrial companies, due to some [PAGE 8] crucial characteristics: decentralization (as it is a peer-to-peer network and there is no need [PAGE 8] of a central server), distributed consensus protocol, digital signature and secure [PAGE 8] cryptographic based mechanism, peer-to-peer transaction based on decentralized network in [PAGE 8] a distributed systems."
