Expansion of Bitcoin, as well as other digital currencies, has been [PAGE 1] due to lower transaction costs, high security protocols and lack of inflation with respect to [PAGE 1] fiat money and no need of a clearing entity or a central bank. Although, environmental [PAGE 1] issues related to the use of this currency and, in particular, in the energy consumes, have [PAGE 1] been raised by the scientific community, but no signals of limiting factors have been [PAGE 1] detected until now."

The [PAGE 2] innovation introduced by Nakamoto (but it seems there should be a group hided under this [PAGE 2] pseudonym) represents a currency that bypasses the official way to produce and exchange [PAGE 2] money, based on a central bank or a clearing authority, and uses a peer-to-peer payment [PAGE 2] system realised as an open source software. This virtual money run thanks to the [PAGE 2] blockchain technology that create a distributed public register containing all Bitcoin [PAGE 2] transactions."

Bitcoin and blockchain technology [PAGE 2] Bitcoin is a cryptocurrency based on the blockchain technology, which make use of secure [PAGE 2] cryptographic algorithms supported by a peer-to-peer network. Blockchain is based on the [PAGE 2] following assumption: it rely on a peer-to-peer network and there is no need of a central [PAGE 2] server, it has a distributed consensus protocol that consists of digital signature and [PAGE 2] cryptography based on asymmetric public key mechanism, a timestamp system to make [PAGE 2] transaction traceable in a peer-to-peer network in which all nodes in the network are equal [PAGE 2] peers."

[PAGE 4] The author assessed in the 2019 (until September) an average energy consumption equal to [PAGE 4] 73.21TWh that correspond to the release of 34.73 MtCO 2 or CO 2 emitted by Denmark in [PAGE 4] the same year (de Vries, 2019a). [PAGE 4] In figure no. 1 is shown two trends of CO 2 emitted by energy consumed for Bitcoin [PAGE 4] transactions. According to de Vries (2019b) the energy consumption is an estimation, so the [PAGE 4] blue and yellow line consider the maximum and minus quantity of CO 2 release by all [PAGE 4] transactions. In both trends there is an increased from 2017 to the end of 2018 followed by [PAGE 4] a decrease. In the begin of 2019 a new increase is observed.

[PAGE 6] But despite these undeniable benefits, Bitcoin has not yet imposed itself on traditional [PAGE 6] payment systems. It presents a strong acceptance limit, in the sense that it can be spent for [PAGE 6] the purchase of goods and services online only in special sites that provide payments with [PAGE 6] virtual currency; its use is tied to the availability of a technology necessary for access not at [PAGE 6] the moment universally widespread. This limitation is a huge disadvantage both for the [PAGE 6] differences between countries and for the difficulty of access to the most modern [PAGE 6] technologies by the poorest section of the population."
