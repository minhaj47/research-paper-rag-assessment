      "preview": "[PAGE 1] 1. Introduction [PAGE 1] In the current world, centralized systems govern the majority of ﬁnancial transactions [PAGE 1] between people or businesses. In other cases, they can be managed by a third-party [PAGE 1] organization. In the case of a digital payment or transfer between two businesses, a bank or [PAGE 1] credit card vendor, for example, functions as a third party. All successful transactions are [PAGE 1] paid for by the client ﬁrms. A third-party ﬁrm handles and manages practically all of the [PAGE 1] interaction in the online process in this one-size-ﬁts-all approach. This approach obviously [PAGE 1] requires the use of a third party to ensure the transaction’s security. A blockchain, on the [PAGE 1] other hand, is a widely dispersed and securely managed peer-to-peer network where no [PAGE 1] third party is necessary to handle information and trust between network users. [PAGE 1] Blockchain technology is a cutting-edge concept with a promising future."

[PAGE 3] One of the research objectives is to elaborate on the basic concept of blockchain and [PAGE 3] cryptocurrency. Therefore, the purpose of RQ1 is to present the details regarding the [PAGE 3] concept and history behind blockchain and cryptocurrency and to make its origin and [PAGE 3] implementation clear.

A systematic literature review is presented. The approaches for scalabil- [PAGE 20] ity proposed in the literature have been classiﬁed as protocol-based approaches, layered [PAGE 20] approaches, sharding-based approaches, approaches based on compression, and miscella- [PAGE 20] neous approaches. The paper also proposed immersion cooling as a solution to improve [PAGE 20] power consumption. Immersion cooling is a much more efﬁcient cooling methodology. [PAGE 20] By using the non-conductive ﬂuid, one can have best-in-class power density coupled [PAGE 20] with best-in-class energy efﬁciency. Ultimately the compactness of hardware leads to a [PAGE 20] simpliﬁed design. [PAGE 20] The cooling technology is particularly important to Bitcoin mining because of how [PAGE 20] much energy it requires to perform it computationally."
