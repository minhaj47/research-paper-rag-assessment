With the passage of time, the sustainability issue of blockchain is rising. This [PAGE 1] paper discusses two major sustainability issues of blockchain: power consumption and scalability. [PAGE 1] It discusses the challenge of power consumption by analyzing various approaches to estimating [PAGE 1] power consumption in the literature. A case study of bitcoin is presented for this purpose. The study [PAGE 1] presents a review of the growing energy consumption of bitcoin along with a solution for immersion [PAGE 1] cooling in blockchain mining. The second challenge addressed in this research is scalability. With [PAGE 1] the increase in network size, scalability issues are also increasing as the number of transactions per [PAGE 1] second is decreasing. In other words, blockchain is observing low throughput with its increase in [PAGE 1] size."

In other cases, they can be managed by a third-party [PAGE 1] organization. In the case of a digital payment or transfer between two businesses, a bank or [PAGE 1] credit card vendor, for example, functions as a third party. All successful transactions are [PAGE 1] paid for by the client ﬁrms. A third-party ﬁrm handles and manages practically all of the [PAGE 1] interaction in the online process in this one-size-ﬁts-all approach. This approach obviously [PAGE 1] requires the use of a third party to ensure the transaction’s security. A blockchain, on the [PAGE 1] other hand, is a widely dispersed and securely managed peer-to-peer network where no [PAGE 1] third party is necessary to handle information and trust between network users. [PAGE 1] Blockchain technology is a cutting-edge concept with a promising future."

Imran [ 31 ], in his discussion of Bitcoin Mining’s Economic Beneﬁts, [PAGE 10] proposes that the mining process could aid in energy redistribution and the utilization of [PAGE 10] renewable energy sources. However, there are presently no realistic methodologies for [PAGE 10] estimating cryptocurrency mining electricity use. The only concrete statistic is the absolute [PAGE 10] minimum energy consumption calculated by multiplying the network hash rate by the [PAGE 10] most optimal miner’s energy efﬁciency. From 5 June 2020 to 4 June 2021, the total network [PAGE 10] hash rate of Bitcoin (as shown in Figure 9 ) was around 151.415 million TH/s [ 32 ].

[PAGE 17] By enabling data storage to be accessible, decentralized, and unchangeable, blockchains [PAGE 17] have revolutionized storage space. Public blockchain technologies, such as the one used by [PAGE 17] Bitcoin, face scaling problems since their blockchains are so big and are getting bigger. Block [PAGE 17] summarizing, a technique for lowering blockchain memory consumption in setups with [PAGE 17] transferable transactions is presented in this article. With the described method, data can [PAGE 17] be stored in a way that is accessible to light nodes with few resources."
