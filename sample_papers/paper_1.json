In other cases, they can be managed by a third-party organization. In the case of a digital payment or transfer between two businesses, a bank or credit card vendor, for example, functions as a third party. All successful transactions are paid for by the client ﬁrms. A third-party ﬁrm handles and manages practically all of the interaction in the online process in this one-size-ﬁts-all approach. This approach obviously requires the use of a third party to ensure the transaction’s security. A blockchain, on the other hand, is a widely dispersed and securely managed peer-to-peer network where no third party is necessary to handle information and trust between network users. Blockchain technology is a cutting-edge concept with a promising future. Haber and Stornetta introduced blockchain, and Satoshi Namakoto introduced the Bitcoin system in 2008, which drew much attention."

The ﬁrst contribution of this study is to highlight the energy consumption estimations in blockchain and propose a solution based on the current circumstances. For this, we use the data obtained from different real-time sites to estimate Bitcoin’s rise in power consumption. Cooling and IT hardware losses have a signiﬁcant impact, yet they have been generally ignored in earlier research. Prior studies, such as Krause et al. [ 3 ], which make projections about upcoming carbon emissions or compare bitcoin and metal mining, are based on basic energy consumption estimations and lack empirical grounding [ 4 , 5 ].

One of the research objectives is to elaborate on the basic concept of blockchain and cryptocurrency. Therefore, the purpose of RQ1 is to present the details regarding the concept and history behind blockchain and cryptocurrency and to make its origin and implementation clear. RQ2: How does blockchain technology make life easier for consumers worldwide by mining? This research question is in the continuity of RQ1 to explain blockchain mining, in particular, as a paradigm for the computational effort that nodes in the network perform in the hopes of obtaining additional tokens."
