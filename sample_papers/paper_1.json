    "subject": "Blockchain is a peer-to-peer trustless network that keeps records of digital assets without any central authority. With the passage of time, the sustainability issue of blockchain is rising. This paper discusses two major sustainability issues of blockchain: power consumption and scalability. It discusses the challenge of power consumption by analyzing various approaches to estimating power consumption in the literature. A case study of bitcoin is presented for this purpose. The study presents a review of the growing energy consumption of bitcoin along with a solution for immersion cooling in blockchain mining. The second challenge addressed in this research is scalability. With the increase in network size, scalability issues are also increasing as the number of transactions per second is decreasing. In other words, blockchain is observing low throughput with its increase in size. The paper discusses research studies and techniques proposed in the literature. The paper then investigates how to scale blockchain for better performance.",

In other cases, they can be managed by a third-party [PAGE 1] organization. In the case of a digital payment or transfer between two businesses, a bank or [PAGE 1] credit card vendor, for example, functions as a third party. All successful transactions are [PAGE 1] paid for by the client ﬁrms. A third-party ﬁrm handles and manages practically all of the [PAGE 1] interaction in the online process in this one-size-ﬁts-all approach. This approach obviously [PAGE 1] requires the use of a third party to ensure the transaction’s security. A blockchain, on the [PAGE 1] other hand, is a widely dispersed and securely managed peer-to-peer network where no [PAGE 1] third party is necessary to handle information and trust between network users. [PAGE 1] Blockchain technology is a cutting-edge concept with a promising future."

However, there are presently no realistic methodologies for [PAGE 10] estimating cryptocurrency mining electricity use. The only concrete statistic is the absolute [PAGE 10] minimum energy consumption calculated by multiplying the network hash rate by the [PAGE 10] most optimal miner’s energy efﬁciency. From 5 June 2020 to 4 June 2021, the total network [PAGE 10] hash rate of Bitcoin (as shown in Figure 9 ) was around 151.415 million TH/s [ 32 ].

The summary of the characteristics of currently available energy-efﬁcient [PAGE 17] 22.318 percent, and space-saving for compressed summary blocks is 78.104 percent. [PAGE 17] By enabling data storage to be accessible, decentralized, and unchangeable, blockchains [PAGE 17] have revolutionized storage space. Public blockchain technologies, such as the one used by [PAGE 17] Bitcoin, face scaling problems since their blockchains are so big and are getting bigger. Block [PAGE 17] summarizing, a technique for lowering blockchain memory consumption in setups with [PAGE 17] transferable transactions is presented in this article. With the described method, data can [PAGE 17] be stored in a way that is accessible to light nodes with few resources."

Although the power [PAGE 13] consumption per operation is substantially reduced for other PoW-based cryptocurrencies, [PAGE 13] it is nevertheless orders of magnitude more energy-intensive than, for instance, a typical [PAGE 13] reservation in the banking system. Furthermore, since theoretically, the blocks may be [PAGE 13] indeﬁnitely bigger, it is crucial to recognize that the quantity of transactions executed has [PAGE 13] no impact on the overall network’s exploration and mining power usage. For PoW-based [PAGE 13] digital currencies, the statistic “energy consumption per transaction” must be strictly taken [PAGE 13] into account. However, considering how well Bitcoin and other existing PoW blockchains [PAGE 13] operate, its power usage can undoubtedly be viewed as unsustainable [ 44 ]. [PAGE 13] 4.3."
