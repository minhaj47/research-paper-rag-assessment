[PAGE 1] The companies in the maritime transport sector are facing notable challenges [PAGE 1] resulting from the emergence of disruptive technologies, for example, the lack of regulation and [PAGE 1] the issues of security and privacy. Nevertheless, the disruptive innovations deﬁnitely possess a [PAGE 1] potential to improve transport business [ 2 ]. The blockchain, as a disruptive technology and a driver of [PAGE 1] digital transformation, is projected to be the latest transformative innovation and is increasingly gaining [PAGE 1] attention from academics, practitioners, and regulators across various industries [ 3 , 4 ]."
