In fact, there [PAGE 1] is reason to believe that non-PoW block- [PAGE 1] chains may enable [PAGE 1] applications that [PAGE 1] contribute to sustainability, for instance, [PAGE 1] by reducing wasteful practices in food [PAGE 1] supply [PAGE 1] chains, 3 [PAGE 1] container [PAGE 1] shipment, 4 [PAGE 1] and public services 5 or by facilitating [PAGE 1] more efﬁcient carbon markets. 6 [PAGE 1] In this commentary, we consequently [PAGE 1] argue for a broader debate on the sus- [PAGE 1] tainability of blockchain. We begin our [PAGE 1] argument with a discussion of the sig- [PAGE 1] niﬁcant energy savings that can be real- [PAGE 1] ized for public blockchains by using [PAGE 1] proof of stake (PoS) instead of PoW."

[PAGE 4] We particularly caution against blindly [PAGE 4] extending [PAGE 4] the [PAGE 4] critique [PAGE 4] of [PAGE 4] PoW [PAGE 4] to [PAGE 4] PoS and private blockchains, which [PAGE 4] both have low energy needs. Since [PAGE 4] some of them may even add to sustain- [PAGE 4] ability, we also see a need for a [PAGE 4] more [PAGE 4] balanced [PAGE 4] debate [PAGE 4] that [PAGE 4] goes [PAGE 4] beyond environmental costs and re- [PAGE 4] ﬂects [PAGE 4] on [PAGE 4] environmental [PAGE 4] beneﬁts. [PAGE 4] This debate can build on ongoing ef- [PAGE 4] forts to identify areas of application [PAGE 4] in which blockchain could contribute [PAGE 4] to [PAGE 4] sustainability."
